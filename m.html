        <h2>Magic Messi</h2>
        <p class="para">Lionel Messi, a name that echoes through the annals of football history, a maestro whose artistry on the pitch transcends the boundaries of imagination. In the realm of football, Messi is not just a player; he is a phenomenon, a living testament to the beauty and brilliance that the sport can embody.

            Born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina, Messi's journey from a young prodigy to a global icon is a tale of perseverance, talent, and an unwavering commitment to the beautiful game. His diminutive stature belies the immense impact he has had on the world of football, as he has danced past defenders and defied the laws of physics to become a goal-scoring machine.
            
            Messi's time with FC Barcelona was a symphony of success. For over two decades, he graced the Camp Nou with a magical blend of speed, agility, and an innate ability to read the game. The combination of his low center of gravity and lightning-quick dribbling left defenders in his wake, while his precise finishing turned goal-scoring into an art form. The iconic duo of Messi and Barcelona became synonymous with excellence, as they claimed numerous domestic and international titles.</p>

                The Argentine's last goal for the Spanish giants came in a 2-1 defeat to Celta Vigo at home. But what he had done between the two goals will live <br> in the minds of football fans forever. The Argentine captured a club-record 35 trophies for Barcelona, while also picking up the prestigious Ballon d'Or <br> eight times

                The first Champions League win enjoyed by Messi comes with an asterisk that the man himself applied.

Frank Rijkaard’s Barca beat Arsenal 2-1 in the 2006 final in Paris, with a teenage Messi sidelined by a hamstring injury he sustained during the last-16 win over Chelsea.

As a result, he skipped Barcelona’s post-match celebrations, a move he later said he regretted.

Three years later, Messi was back and at centre stage, heading home the second goal as the Blaugrana beat Manchester United 2-0 in the 2009 final in Rome, part of a historic treble claimed during Pep Guardiola’s first season in charge.

At Wembley in 2011, Guardiola’s men repeated the trick, beating Alex Ferguson’s United 3-1, with Pedro, Messi and David Villa on target.
Maddening semifinal losses to Inter Milan and Chelsea followed each of those title wins, but Barca were top dogs again in 2015.

Playing under Luis Enrique, and with Messi as part of the “MSN” forward line alongside Luis Suarez and Neymar, Juventus were swept aside 3-1 in Berlin as Messi notched a fourth continental title.

Messi was 28 at that point, operating at the peak of his powers in one of the most destructive club sides ever seen. It felt crazy to imagine that 2015 would still stand as his most recent Champions League triumph almost eight years later.

        <h1 class="head">Messi's World Cup triumph</h1>
        <p class="para">
            Messi finally achieved World Cup glory with La Albiceleste in Qatar last year as Argentina beat France on penalties in the final to win international football's top prize for a third time and the first since 1986. Messi won the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player, finishing with seven goals and three assists from seven appearances, playing every single minute of Argentina's campaign to lead them to silverware.Many felt Messi needed to win the World Cup to confirm his place as the best football player of all time, and he responded with a magnificent campaign in Qatar before Argentina ultimately took the crown.

            Messi scored twice in the final, finishing just one goal behind Golden Boot winner Kylian Mbappe, who netted a hat-trick on the losing side as his side finished runners-up.His extraordinary tournament saw him score in the group stage, round of 16, quarter-final, semi-final and final, the first player to ever achieve that feat at a World Cup, while his 26 appearances at the tournament is also a record, after he surpassed Lothar Matthaus.

            Messi's goals made him the first ever South American player to score in both the World Cup and Champions League final, and he joined his idol Diego Maradona as the only two players to score five or more goals and create 20 or more chances in a single World Cup tournament.
